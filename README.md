# Freesound-data-set

Need to add this files in order to use tools.py for annotations:
- tag_cooccurrences.pkl
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6I4aBwnXxoGY2Z5dG5vdnlwSGM
- tag_to_idx_cooc_matrix.pkl
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6I4aBwnXxoGU2NpU3pwSGNWbms


ex file provide a example of how to use annotation tools.
For now each annotator will provide an ontology_***.json file with his annotation.
